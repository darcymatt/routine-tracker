### Project Description
Our project is  a basic routine tracker which includes a checkmark option for marking completed tasks, 12-hour time format, real-time clock, and a calendar for planning future days. It ensures no tasks can have start times before the current time, and gives alerts for missed or ongoing tasks. Rescheduling is built to accommodate task timings, with fixed-time options and maintenance of task allocation ratios. The system disallows overlapping tasks, and prevents invalid task submissions with distinct alerts.

### The Problem statement
This website solves the problem of efficiently managing and organizing daily routines by helping users schedule tasks, track progress, and handle missed tasks. It prevents overlapping tasks, ensures tasks are assigned realistic durations, and allows rescheduling without disrupting the entire routine.

### The Solution
We solve this problem with a structured task management system that ensures logical scheduling, real-time tracking, and intelligent rescheduling. The system prevents overlapping tasks, enforces valid start times, maintains priority order, and respects fixed-time constraints. Missed tasks trigger automatic rescheduling within available time while preserving logical time allocation. A calendar allows future planning, real-time alerts keep users informed, and validation checks prevent invalid entries. Users can also choose to skip tasks if needed, making the system flexible yet efficient for daily routine management.
